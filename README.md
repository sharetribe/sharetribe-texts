# Sharetribe texts

Sharetribe texts are the Marketplace and Email texts added as default to new Sharetribe accounts created at https://www.sharetribe.com/. Some translations are also available.


## Marketplace texts

Marketplace texts are short texts used across dynamic pages of a Sharetribe marketplace, like button labels, error messages, and help texts. They can be edited in Sharetribe Console at [Build > Content > Marketplace texts](https://console.sharetribe.com/a/content/marketplace-texts).

In the [marketplace-texts](marketplace-texts/) folder, you can find the latest version of the Sharetribe Marketplace texts. The filename signals the language.
